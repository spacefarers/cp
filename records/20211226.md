### Problem 2. HILO

I spent a lot of time solving this problem, but I was able to solve it independently. 

The key thing is thinking about what would happen on each step, and the answer is that the one you are working with changes from HI to LO, but not all are visible, so you need to model when each node becomes visible in amortized O(n) or O(nlogn) time. This would be an addition to the time complexity, which wouldnâ€™t cause any problems.

Now with my current knowledge on the gold version problem I will try to take on the plat version after a short break.
