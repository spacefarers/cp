## USACO 2021 December Contest, Gold

### Problem 1. Paired Up

I gave up on solving the HILO platinum one because not only is it way different than the gold one, the editorial is confusing and none of them offered me insights as to how to solve it. So I went on to solve this one.



This problem I was not able to solve independently. The key is to recognize the dp on the second type of query.
